# PromiseGrid Design Questions

## For Discussion with Steve (PromiseGrid Lead)

*Document prepared: November 30, 2025*
*Status: Brainstorming / Pre-discussion*

---

## Overview

This document contains theoretical questions about PromiseGrid's economic layer, token system, and enforcement model. These questions emerged from brainstorming sessions about integrating Promise Theory economics (specifically Mark Burgess's MoneyBook concepts) into PromiseGrid and the collab-editor application.

The goal is to clarify design decisions that will affect both kernel-level architecture and application-level implementations.

---

## Section 1: The Economic Layer

### Core Question: Should PromiseGrid have an explicit economic layer?

**Our Position**: Yes, absolutely.

**Rationale**:
- Mark Burgess's MoneyBook argues that money is fundamentally "accounting for transactions"
- Collaboration involves real transactions: attention, labor, document space, review time
- These scarce resources are currently exchanged without explicit accounting
- Making transactions visible could help prevent tragedy of the commons

**Questions for Steve**:

1. **Is an economic layer in scope for PromiseGrid core?**
   - Or should economics be purely application-level?

2. **Where should the economic layer live?**
   - Kernel-level (fundamental to PromiseGrid)?
   - Protocol-level (CBOR messages include economic fields)?
   - Application-level (each app implements its own)?

3. **What's the relationship to existing PromiseGrid concepts?**
   - How does this relate to capability tokens?
   - How does this relate to the reputation tracking mentioned in the README?

---

## Section 2: Unified Token/Credit Model

### Core Question: Are capability tokens and credits the same thing?

**Our Position**: Yes, we believe tokens ARE credits — not parallel systems.

**Proposed Model**: Tokens as Tickets (consumed when used)
- Tokens grant access to a capability
- Using the token consumes it
- To do more, you need to earn more tokens
- This creates natural scarcity and incentive to contribute

**Alternative Model to Consider**: Tokens as Shares
- Tokens represent partial "ownership" or stake
- Having more tokens = more influence
- Tokens aren't consumed but distribution determines power

**Questions for Steve**:

1. **Is the "tokens as tickets" model correct?**
   - Are tokens consumed when used?
   - Or do they persist as ongoing access rights?

2. **Can a single token serve multiple functions?**
   - Access control (capability)
   - Economic value (credit)
   - Reputation proof (track record)
   - Voting weight (governance)

3. **If tokens are unified, how do we handle different "denominations"?**
   - Is editing a document the same "cost" as restructuring it?
   - Are all kept promises worth the same token value?

---

## Section 3: Token Creation

### Core Question: How are tokens created?

**Our Position**: Tokens are generated by kept promises (Option D).

**The Model**:
```
Promise Made → Promise Kept → Token Generated
                    ↓
            Token = Proof of Reliability
                    ↓
         Accumulated Tokens = Track Record
```

This aligns directly with Promise Theory: trust increases as agents build a history of reliability in fulfilling promises.

**Alternative Models Considered**:
- Contribution Mining: Tokens created when you contribute value (possibly also true)
- Issuance by Authority: Room/document creator issues tokens (probably not)
- Mutual Credit: Tokens created in pairs (+1/-1) (uncertain)

**Questions for Steve**:

1. **Is "kept promise generates token" the right creation model?**

2. **What counts as a "promise" in PromiseGrid?**
   - Any action? Explicit declarations? Capability usage?

3. **What does "kept" mean?**
   - Not reverted?
   - Accepted by promisee?
   - Persisted for a time period?
   - Verified by witnesses?

4. **Who decides if a promise was kept?**
   - The promisee (recipient)?
   - The network (consensus)?
   - Automatic (algorithmic)?

5. **Can tokens also be issued by authorities for bootstrapping?**
   - How do new users/nodes get started?
   - Is there a "genesis" token distribution?

---

## Section 4: Token Transferability

### Core Question: Can tokens be transferred between agents?

**Our Position**: Probably not, but uncertain.

**Arguments for Non-Transferable**:
- Tokens = proof of YOUR kept promises
- You can't buy a good reputation
- Philosophically cleaner
- Prevents gaming/markets for trust

**Arguments for Transferable**:
- More economically flexible
- Enables gifting/sponsorship of newcomers
- Creates a true "currency"
- Allows specialization (some earn, some spend)

**Questions for Steve**:

1. **Should tokens be transferable?**

2. **If non-transferable, how do newcomers bootstrap?**
   - Grace period?
   - Sponsor/vouch system?
   - Starting allocation?

3. **If transferable, how do we prevent reputation markets?**
   - Can you buy your way to trust?
   - Is that acceptable?

4. **Hybrid model possible?**
   - Some token types transferable, others not?
   - "Earned reputation" vs. "granted access"?

## Section 5: Token Decay

### Core Question: Do old kept promises matter as much as recent ones?

**Our Position**: Uncertain — good question for Steve.

**Options**:

| Model | Description | Implication |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| No decay | Lifetime track record counts forever | Early contributors have permanent advantage |
| Full decay | Only recent promises count | Constant contribution required |
| Weighted | Recent tokens count more, old ones persist | Balance between history and recency |

**Questions for Steve**:

1. **Should tokens decay over time?**

2. **If decay, what's the rate?**
   - Linear? Exponential?
   - Time-based? Activity-based?

3. **Does context matter?**
   - Maybe decay in active projects, no decay in archived ones?

4. **How does this affect long-term contributors?**
   - Should founders have permanent elevated status?
   - Or must everyone continuously contribute?

## Section 6: Broken Promises

### Core Question: What happens when a promise is broken?

**Our Position**: Uncertain — needs design discussion.

**Options**:

| Model | When Promise Broken | Effect |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| No reward | No token generated | Neutral — just no gain |
| Negative token | Anti-token created | Active penalty — debt |
| Token burn | Existing tokens consumed | Penalty from reserves |

**Questions for Steve**:

1. **How does the system know a promise was broken?**
   - Explicit rejection by promisee?
   - Timeout without fulfillment?
   - Reversion of action?

2. **Should broken promises have active penalties?**
   - Or just absence of reward?

3. **Is there forgiveness/appeal?**
   - Can broken promise records be cleared?
   - Statute of limitations?

4. **How do we handle accidents vs. bad faith?**
   - Network failure caused non-fulfillment
   - vs. deliberate abandonment

---

## Section 7: Enforcement Model

### Core Question: How is the economic layer enforced?

**Our Position**: Enforcement is voluntary and distributed.

**The Model**:
- No central authority sets rules
- Each node operator sets personal thresholds
- "Do I trust this agent based on their tokens?"
- Network behavior emerges from individual choices

**Example**:
> As a user, I CHOOSE to let someone use my server. If someone doesn't have many tokens, I might decline. If someone has been a great member of the grid, I wouldn't have second thoughts about sharing my resources.

This aligns with Promise Theory's voluntary cooperation principle.

**Questions for Steve**:

1. **Is this the intended enforcement model?**
   - Purely distributed/voluntary?
   - Or will there be network-wide minimums?

2. **How do thresholds get communicated?**
   - Does a node advertise "I require X tokens"?
   - Or is it discovered through rejection?

3. **Is enforcement consistent with Promise Theory autonomy?**
   - Framing: "I promised to follow these rules, system helps me keep my promise"
   - Does this resolve the autonomy/accountability tension?

4. **What about bad actors who lie about their thresholds?**
   - Accept request, then don't fulfill?
   - How is this handled?

## Section 8: Implementation Questions

### For Kernel/Protocol Design

1. **What's the CBOR message structure for token-related events?**
   - Promise made
   - Promise kept/broken
   - Token generated
   - Token spent

2. **Where is token state stored?**
   - In the decentralized cache?
   - Content-addressable by agent ID?

3. **How is token balance computed?**
   - Sum of all token events?
   - Cached balance with updates?

4. **How do nodes verify token claims?**
   - Request proof from other nodes?
   - Consensus on token history?

### For Application Layer (Collab-Editor)

5. **Should collab-editor prototype this before kernel decisions?**
   - Test concepts in real collaboration
   - Learn what works
   - Inform kernel design

6. **What's the minimum viable implementation?**
   - Just tracking? (visibility)
   - Tracking + display? (social pressure)  
   - Tracking + thresholds? (voluntary enforcement)

## Section 9: Open Philosophical Questions

These are deeper questions that may not have immediate answers but are worth discussing:

1. **Is PromiseGrid fundamentally a reputation network?**
   - Not just compute — trust infrastructure
   - Tokens as portable reputation

2. **Can non-human agents (AI) participate in the token economy?**
   - Do they earn tokens?
   - Who bears their costs?

3. **How does this scale?**
   - Millions of agents, billions of tokens
   - Performance implications?

4. **What prevents Sybil attacks?**
   - Creating many identities to farm tokens
   - How is identity anchored?

5. **Is there a role for "negative trust"?**
   - Not just "I don't know you" but "I actively distrust you"
   - Blacklists? Warnings?

## Next Steps

1. Review this document with Steve
2. Get alignment on core model (tokens = kept promise proofs)
3. Decide kernel vs. application layer
4. If application layer: begin collab-editor prototype
5. If kernel layer: contribute to PromiseGrid core design
