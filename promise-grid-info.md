# PromiseGrid: A Reputation Network


*Document prepared: November 30, 2025*

## What is PromiseGrid?

PromiseGrid is a decentralized computing system — but that description misses what makes it special. At its heart, PromiseGrid is really a **trust network** built on promises.

Think of it this way:

> **The Internet connects computers. PromiseGrid connects trust.**

## The Big Idea: Promises, Not Commands

Traditional computer systems work on commands and obligations:
- "Server, do this task"
- "User, you must follow these rules"
- "System, execute this instruction"

PromiseGrid works differently. Everything is a **promise**:
- "I promise to store this data"
- "I promise to complete this computation"
- "I promise to share my resources with you"

Why does this matter? Because promises are **voluntary**. No one is forced to do anything. Cooperation happens because agents *choose* to cooperate.

---

## Where This Idea Comes From

PromiseGrid is built on **Promise Theory**, developed by Mark Burgess (a physicist turned computer scientist). The key insights:

### 1. Autonomous Agents

Everything in the system is an autonomous agent — computers, users, services, even AI assistants. Each agent controls only itself. No agent can force another agent to do anything.

### 2. Voluntary Cooperation

Agents work together by making promises to each other. "I promise to help you if you promise to help me." Cooperation emerges from many individual choices, not from top-down control.

### 3. Trust Through History

How do you know if you can trust someone's promise? You look at their history. Have they kept promises before? The more promises someone has kept, the more you trust their future promises.

## Tokens: Proof of Kept Promises

Here's where it gets interesting. In PromiseGrid:

> **Every time you keep a promise, you earn a token.**

A token is proof that you did what you said you would do. It's like a receipt for reliability.

Over time, you accumulate tokens. Your collection of tokens IS your reputation. It's not what you say about yourself — it's the verified record of what you've actually done.

```
Promise Made → Promise Kept → Token Earned
                                   ↓
                        Token = Proof of Reliability
                                   ↓
              Many Tokens = Strong Reputation
```

## How Trust Works in Practice

Let's say Alice wants to use Bob's computer for a calculation.

**In a traditional system:**
- Some administrator decides if Alice has permission
- Rules are set centrally
- Alice either has access or doesn't

**In PromiseGrid:**
- Bob looks at Alice's tokens (her history of kept promises)
- Bob decides: "Does she have enough tokens for me to trust her?"
- Bob makes a personal choice based on Alice's track record

Bob might think:
- "Alice has 100 tokens — she's clearly reliable. Sure, use my computer."
- "Alice has 3 tokens — I don't know her yet. Maybe I'll wait."
- "Alice has 500 tokens — she's one of the most trusted people on the grid!"

The key insight: **Bob decides.** Not a central authority. Not a rule. Bob, as an autonomous agent, makes his own choice about who to trust.

## Why This Matters

### No Central Point of Control

There's no single entity deciding who's trustworthy. Trust emerges from thousands of individual judgments. This makes the system:
- **Resilient** — No single point of failure
- **Fair** — No gatekeeper playing favorites
- **Honest** — Reputation is earned, not assigned

### No Fake Reputation

You can't buy tokens. You can't fake them. They're generated by actually keeping promises. The only way to build a good reputation is to... actually be reliable.

### Natural Consequences

Bad actors naturally get excluded. If you break promises:
- You don't earn tokens
- Others see your low token count
- They choose not to share resources with you
- No one "punishes" you — they just don't trust you

Good actors naturally thrive:
- Keep promises → earn tokens
- More tokens → more trust
- More trust → more opportunities
- Virtuous cycle

## The Grid as a Trust Economy

Mark Burgess wrote a book called the "MoneyBook" about how money is really just "accounting for transactions." PromiseGrid takes this seriously.

In the grid:
- **Tokens are like money** — but for trust, not dollars
- **Every interaction is a transaction** — promises exchanged
- **Balance matters** — are you contributing as much as you're taking?

But unlike money:
- You can't transfer tokens (you can't buy reputation)
- Tokens represent YOUR actions, not abstract value
- The "economy" is about cooperation, not competition

## Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Agent** | Any participant — person, computer, service, AI |
| **Promise** | A voluntary commitment to do something |
| **Kept Promise** | A promise that was actually fulfilled |
| **Token** | Proof that a promise was kept |
| **Reputation** | Your accumulated tokens (track record) |
| **Trust** | Others' willingness to work with you based on reputation |
| **Enforcement** | Not rules — just individual choices about who to trust |

## How This Applies to the Collab-Editor

The collaborative text editor is one application that will run on PromiseGrid. Here's how the trust model applies:

### Every Action is a Promise

When you edit a document, you're implicitly promising: "This edit adds value."

If the edit persists (isn't reverted), the promise was kept. You earn a token.

### Reputation Affects Collaboration

- High-reputation users: Their edits might be auto-accepted
- Low-reputation users: Others might review their edits more carefully
- New users: Need to build up trust through small contributions

### No Central Editor-in-Chief

There's no single person deciding whose edits are "approved." Each collaborator makes their own judgment about whose contributions to trust.

## Common Questions

### "What if someone games the system?"

You can't fake kept promises. The tokens are generated when you actually fulfill commitments. Gaming would require... actually being reliable. Which isn't gaming.

### "What about new users?"

New users start with few tokens. They build reputation through small, low-risk contributions. It's like any community — you prove yourself over time.

### "Isn't this just popularity?"

No. It's not about who likes you. It's about whether you keep your promises. An unpopular person who reliably delivers will have high reputation. A popular person who flakes will have low reputation.

### "What if I disagree with someone's trust threshold?"

That's fine! Everyone sets their own thresholds. Some people are more trusting, some are more cautious. The system doesn't impose a single standard.

### "Can AI agents have reputation?"

Yes! If an AI keeps its promises (completes tasks, provides accurate information), it earns tokens like anyone else. The system doesn't distinguish between human and non-human agents.

## The Vision

PromiseGrid imagines a world where:

- **Trust is portable** — Your reputation follows you across applications
- **Cooperation is natural** — People help each other because it's mutually beneficial
- **Bad actors are isolated** — Not by punishment, but by natural consequences
- **Power is distributed** — No central authority decides who's worthy

It's not just a technical system. It's a model for how communities can self-organize based on voluntary cooperation and earned trust.

### Key Quote

From the PromiseGrid README:

> "PromiseGrid is to computation what the Internet is to communication — the Internet is a decentralized network; PromiseGrid is a decentralized computer. Owned and operated by its users rather than any single legal entity, the grid is scalable and resilient, growing as users join."
