# EX6 in plain English

## The short version

EX6 is a small runtime for keeping operational knowledge. It is not yet a full
application with screens and buttons. Think of it as the reliable machinery
underneath an application: it records facts, checks known rules, keeps exact
files, and can exchange those files with another independent computer.

The important promise is simple:

> A workflow can be packaged exactly once, identified by its contents, sent to
> another node, verified there, and kept there without that receiving node
> silently deciding to run it.

## The three things EX6 keeps

### 1. Operational records

Packages such as `context`, `procedures`, and `runs` create durable records:
places, procedures, evidence, approvals, and so on. EX6 stores the exact bytes
and can relay them to a peer.

### 2. Workflow artifacts

A workflow is a directory of instructions, policies, examples, and a
`workflow.json` manifest. EX6 turns that directory into a deterministic tar
archive: the same valid directory always produces the same bytes.

Those bytes are stored in CAS (content-addressed storage). CAS gives the
archive a CID, like this:

```
bafkreiahdp34nto2rnnqde26jw3xnkd6xnlalnr72sug3w7tjb3bhhoj4q
```

That CID is the identity of the exact workflow version. If one character in
the workflow changes, the CID changes too.

### 3. Local lifecycle decisions

Each computer decides for itself whether it has merely imported a workflow,
made it active, deactivated it, or revoked it. Those decisions are append-only
lifecycle events in local CAS.

This distinction matters:

```
has the workflow bytes       !=       has decided to use the workflow
```

Receiving an artifact does not mean receiving authority to run it.

## The basket analogy

The workflow loader is the "basket."

1. Pick up a workflow directory.
2. Put an exact archived copy into the basket (CAS).
3. Give that copy a CID.
4. Optionally mark it active on this computer.
5. Take out the exact copy later for inspection.

Useful commands:

```bash
go run ./cmd/moks workflow demo procedure-execution
go run ./cmd/moks workflow list
go run ./cmd/moks workflow status procedure-execution
go run ./cmd/moks workflow extract procedure-execution ./inspect-here
```

The `demo` command is the easiest local walkthrough. Its four `[ok]` lines
show capture, verification, explicit activation, and exact extraction.

## What the relay is for

The relay lets two separate EX6 runtimes communicate. Each runtime has:

- a separate local state directory;
- separate CAS storage;
- its own peer identity and signing key;
- its own trust choices;
- its own workflow lifecycle decisions.

When Alice sends a workflow to Bob:

```
Alice workflow directory
        ↓ deterministic archive
Alice CAS artifact CID
        ↓ signed relay transfer
Bob verifies signature and CID
        ↓
Bob CAS stores exact artifact bytes
        ↓
Bob stores Alice's lifecycle statement as evidence
        ↓
Bob still has no locally active workflow
```

Bob must explicitly import and activate the artifact if Bob chooses to use it.
That is deliberate: Alice cannot remotely turn on software on Bob's node just
by sending it.

## The public peer-card page you saw

The JSON page is not a user interface. It is a machine-readable business card
for another EX6 node.

```json
{
  "peer_id": "...",
  "public_key": "...",
  "workflow_import_url": "..."
}
```

It tells another node:

- who this node claims to be;
- which public key to use to verify its signatures;
- where to send normal records;
- where to send a workflow artifact.

For a human demo, say:

> “This is the node's public identity and inbox address. Another independent
> node can discover it, verify who it is, and send it an exact workflow
> artifact. This node still decides locally whether to use that workflow.”

## What EX6 does not do yet

EX6 does not automatically execute workflows. It does not yet provide a
finished human-facing workflow screen. It is proving the safer lower-level
parts first:

- exact workflow packaging;
- reproducible identity with CIDs;
- durable history;
- validation;
- explicit local activation;
- independently verified node-to-node transfer.

That is valuable because a user interface can change, but those trust and
evidence boundaries must stay correct underneath it.

## A simple boss-meeting walkthrough

1. Run `workflow demo procedure-execution`.
2. Explain: “The workflow directory became an immutable artifact with a CID.”
3. Show the four `[ok]` lines.
4. Explain: “Activation is an explicit local decision; loading does not run
   anything.”
5. Show the peer card only if discussing decentralized exchange.
6. Explain: “A remote node can receive the exact artifact, but it cannot be
   remotely activated.”

## The one sentence to remember

EX6 makes operational workflows portable and verifiable without letting a
sender take control of the receiver.
