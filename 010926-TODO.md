# Comprehensive To-Do List - Collaborative Editor Development

## 1. CRITICAL BUG FIXES

### 1.1 Cursor Message Synchronization Bug
**Prerequisites:** Codex CLI installed, access to colab-editor repository

- **1.1a** Navigate to colab-editor repository
  - Ensure on correct branch: `CRDT-update`
  - Verify latest changes pulled: `git pull origin CRDT-update`

- **1.1b** Read diagnostic information
  - Open `TODO/002-fix-cursor-message-flow.md` in editor
  - Review Codex's analysis of the issue (from transcript):
    - Node helper missing cursor case in switch statement
    - Browser uses awareness state selection/anchor
    - Node helper sends/receives anchor offsets as part of cursor message
    - Go helper used line/character ranges, node helper uses offsets (CRDT difference)

- **1.1c** Use Codex to diagnose and recommend fix
  - Command: `fix TODO 002` OR
  - More detailed: `read TODO 002 and the 002-fix-* file and recommend a fix for the cursor message bug`
  - Review Codex's recommendations before implementing

- **1.1d** Implement the fix
  - Primary fix: Add cursor message case to node helper's switch statement
  - Location: `nvim/src/node-helper.js` (or similar path)
  - Reconcile awareness state vs anchor offset differences
  - Test cursor updates flow from Neovim → node helper → browser

- **1.1e** Verify the fix
  - Run demo script: `https://github.com/computerscienceiscool/notes/blob/main/neovim-plugin-demo-script.md.pdf`
  - Test cursor synchronization in both directions
  - Verify no "unknown message type" errors appear
  - Check that cursor position updates in real-time

### 1.2 Search Functionality Issues
**Prerequisites:** Container isolation tests passing

- **1.2a** Identify search problems
  - Document what isn't working (noted as "not production-ready" in transcript)
  - Review search implementation in browser and Neovim plugin

- **1.2b** Create test cases for search
  - Test basic text search
  - Test search across documents
  - Test search with special characters

- **1.2c** Fix search implementation
  - Address issues found in testing
  - Ensure works with auto-merge CRDT

## 2. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP

### 2.1 Codex CLI Configuration (JJ)
**Prerequisites:** Node.js installed, OpenAI API key available

- **2.1a** ✅ COMPLETED: Install Codex globally
  - Command already run: `npm install -g @openai/codex-cli`

- **2.1b** ✅ COMPLETED: Configure API key
  - Already pulled from environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

- **2.1c** ✅ COMPLETED: Install global agents.md

  - File location: `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

- **2.1d** Verify global agents.md has checkboxes configuration
  - Command: `cat ~/.codex/AGENTS.md | grep -i checkbox`
  - Should include: "Use checkboxes for completed TODO items"

- **2.1e** Test Codex in colab-editor repository
  - Navigate to: `~/lab/colab-editor`
  - Run: `codex`
  - Test basic commands: `/model`, `/high` (creativity setting)

### 2.2 Claude Code CLI Configuration (Both)
**Prerequisites:** Anthropic account, Node.js installed

- **2.2a** ✅ COMPLETED: Install Claude Code globally
  - Command already run: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

  - Configure API key or web account authentication

- **2.2c** Run init in appropriate repositories
  - Navigate to repo: `cd ~/lab/llm-runtime`
  - Run: `claude init`
  - Review generated `claude.md` file (365 lines)
  - Note: Creates more comprehensive file than Codex's agents.md

- **2.2d** Configure no-emoji preference
  - Add to `claude.md`: "Do not use icons and emojis in documentation or code unless specifically requested"
  - Exception: Toolbars and UI elements where icons improve UX

- **2.2e** Switch between repositories
  - Understand `/theme` command for changing appearance
  - Practice trusting directories when prompted
  - Test that Claude asks before running commands

### 2.3 Global Git Configuration
**Prerequisites:** Git installed

    - `git remote add SteveGT <Steve's-fork-URL>`
  - For each repo, verify remotes: `git remote -v`

- **2.3c** Understand fetch vs pull workflow
  - `git fetch SteveGT` - downloads objects only

  - Both developers use same tool for same repo
  - Prevents commit conflicts in instruction files
  - Allows exploring different tool strengths

- **5.1b** Current repository assignments
  - **colab-editor:** Uses Codex (has AGENTS.md)
  - **llm-runtime:** Uses Claude Code (has claude.md)
  - Document this in shared whiteboard

- **5.1c** When starting work on repository
  1. Navigate to repo
  2. Run `ls` and look for AGENTS.md or claude.md
  3. If AGENTS.md exists: use `codex`
  4. If claude.md exists: use `claude`
  5. Follow that tool's workflow for that project

- **5.1d** Keep instruction files synchronized
  - If using Codex in repo, periodically ask: "sync your agents.md with any claude.md if present"
  - If using Claude in repo, periodically ask: "add instruction to claude.md to match agents.md"
  - Goal: Maintain consistent coding standards across tools
